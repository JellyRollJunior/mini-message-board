## Learning Outcomes
- First express project!
- Practicing server setup, routers, MVC, serving static files
- First time deploying a dynamic site!

## Retrospective (aka yapping)
- A basic (and ugly) project used to practice Express for the first time
- Was pretty fun practicing MVC actually. This is the first time I used MVC where I could actually feel it's usefulness (because I rarely did backend in the past haha)
